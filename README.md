# 🌐 Multi-Site Scraper Project

## 🛠️ Overview
This is a small project designed to scrape as many websites as you need with minimal developer effort. 🚀 The project structure is intentionally simple and efficient to streamline the creation of new scrapers.
This is just a starting point, and you can customize it to fit your needs.

## 🏗️ Project Structure
The workflow is designed to minimize complexity and focus on daily tasks:

1️⃣ **Index Page Handling**  
   - The developer only needs to get an index URL and work on it daily. A new day is a new index page.  
   - This usually involves processing a collection of data that can be handled using tools like `BeautifulSoup` (bs4) or other scraping/crawling libraries.  

2️⃣ **Field Selectors Setup**  
   - Create a new record to store field selectors using XPath or BS4 selectors for each field (e.g., `Bus` fields or other entities).  
   - This ensures detailed pages are processed effectively.

---

## ⚠️ Considerations
- This project works best for websites with an **index page** and corresponding **detail pages**. 🖱️➡️📄  
- The Bus model only has 3 scraped fields as an example. You can add more fields as needed.
- The scraper is designed to **run daily**:  
  1. Scraping all index pages first.  
  2. Scraping all detail pages next.
